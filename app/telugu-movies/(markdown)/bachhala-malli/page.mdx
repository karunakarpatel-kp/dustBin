## Plot Overview:

Hi, Set in the village of Suravaram in Tuni, Andhra Pradesh in the country India, **Bachhala Malli** follows the journey of **Malli (Allari Naresh)**, a talented and determined student. However, a significant decision made by his father causes a rift, transforming Malli into a rebellious and headstrong young man right from his childhood. His life changes when he falls in love with **Kaveri (Amritha Aiyer)**, who feels the same way. But destiny has its own plans for them in this movie. What challenges do they encounter?

**Allari Naresh** acts really well as Malli, making his character exciting and interesting. His acting in this newly released movie makes some scenes really memorable and stunning.

Amritha Aiyer plays **Kaveri** nicely, and she fits perfectly in her role as expected by audience. Rao Ramesh starts off quietly but becomes more important in the second half, making the story even better.

Other actors like **Praveen**, **Rohini Molleti**, and **Kota Jayaram** do a great job too. Even though they don't appear much, they make a big impact.
