In 2024, a young boy named **Zeta** escapes from a secret **Russian lab** near the Indian border. The lab had been experimenting on him to give him superpowers. The lab's leader, Ryan, sends soldiers to catch him. Meanwhile, in Goa, a bounty hunter named Francis Theodore works with his friend Colt, catching criminals for the police. Things get messy when Francis's ex-girlfriend Angela, also a bounty hunter, competes with him for the same jobs.

**Zeta**, on the run, finds his way to Goa and starts following Francis. After Zeta sees Colt kill a criminal, he tries to hide with Angela, but Francis finds him and decides to help him. When Zeta gets sick, Francis takes him to the hospital and then lets him stay at his home. At Francis's house, Zeta begins drawing strange tribal designs, triggering vivid memories of Francis's mysterious past.
