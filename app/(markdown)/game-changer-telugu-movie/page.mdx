## Plot Overview:

There's a new movie called **Game Changer** that's like a big, exciting story about politics and action. A famous director named S. Shankar made it in the Telugu language for the first time. Big stars like Ram Charan, Kiara Advani, and some others are acting in it.

They decided to make this movie in 2021, but it took a long time to finish because they filmed in cool places like Japan, China, and New Zealand. They finished shooting in 2024! The music is super fancy, made by a guy named Thaman S, and some smart people worked on the camera and editing to make it look amazing. Please Watch [Pottel Telugu Movie](https://www.abomma.com/pottel "Pottel telugu movie") at iBOMMA.

The movie will come out on **10 January 2025**, during a special festival called **Sankranti**, and you can watch it in all kinds of super-cool ways, like on giant screens and with fancy sound systems!

Ram Charan is playing two roles in Game Changerâ€”a father and a son. The director, Shankar, said Charan has a special kind of energy that feels powerful even when he acts quietly, and he knows exactly when to make it intense in important scenes.

At first, people thought South Korean actress Bae Suzy might play the main female role, but later, Kiara Advani was chosen in July 2021. This is her second movie with **Ram Charan Tej** after _Vinaya Vidheya Rama_ which was released in the previous year.. Other actors like Anjali, Sunil, Srikanth, Jayaram, and Naveen Chandra are also in the movie. S. J. Suryah joined later as the villain. Fans can't wait to see this amazing cast bring Game Changer to life. Stay tuned to iBOMMA for updates!
