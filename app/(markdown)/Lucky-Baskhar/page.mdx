## Plot Overview:

This is the story of **Baskhar Kumar**, a man living in Bombay in 1992. One day, some officers from the CBI (a group that catches people who break big rules) take him to a bank called Magadha to ask about missing money. They think Baskhar did something wrong with the bank's money. The story then goes back in time to show what really happened.

Three years earlier, **Baskhar** worked as a cashier in the bank. He also helped people fill out bank forms and write checks for a small fee. Baskhar lived with his wife, Sumathi, his little son, Karthik, and his father, Prahalad. They didn't have much money, and Baskhar owed a lot to others. Life was hard.

One day, **Baskhar's** creditor took away his scooter, and someone else got the promotion he wanted. Feeling upset and desperate, Baskhar stole money from the bank and gave it to a smuggler named Anthony to help release TVs stuck at the port. He made double the money, paid back the stolen cash, and earned a profit. This helped him clear his debts, and his family's life started improving.

Anthony planned one last big job before leaving the country—bringing in three fancy foreign cars. Baskhar hesitated but later agreed. With clever tricks, they succeeded, and **Baskhar** again replaced the stolen money. Soon after, he got promoted and decided to stop the risky business, while his friend Samba continued.

As assistant general manager, **Baskhar** found out that a businessman named **Harsha Mehra** was using bank money for bad things. At first, Baskhar wanted to report it, but he realized he could earn more by working with Harsha. He used the money to make his wife's dream of starting a food business come true and made his family rich. But success made Baskhar arrogant, and his wife, Sumathi, destroyed the business in anger. His father, Prahalad, warned him about greed. Feeling sorry, Baskhar changed his ways and fixed his relationship with his family.

Later, **Baskhar** discovered **Harsha** had cheated the bank even more, causing a senior manager to die from shock. Baskhar decided to stop helping Harsha and reported the fraud. Angry bosses tried to scare Baskhar into signing more bad papers, but he tricked them. He had already closed his bank account, stopping the fraud and exposing everyone involved.

In the end, **Baskhar** and his family secretly moved to America with help from Anthony and Prahalad's friends. They bought a hotel and started a new, wealthy life far away.
