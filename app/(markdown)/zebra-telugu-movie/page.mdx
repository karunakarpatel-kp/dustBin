## Plot Overview:

**Surya (Satyadev)** works at a bank. He likes his colleague **Swathi (Priya Bhavani Shankar)**, but he isn't sure how to tell his parents about her. One day, Swathi finds herself in a big problem. To save her, Surya gets into an even bigger mess. He has only four days to pay 5 crores to **Aadi (Daali Dhananjaya)**. Can Surya, just a bank employee, manage such a huge amount? What steps did Surya take to raise 5 crores? The unfolding story is the main part of the film.

The main theme of **Zebra** is quite captivating. The way Surya's character is introduced in the first scene is impressive.

### Conclusion

The main theme, along with the drama between key characters and some **entertaining moments**, is quite enjoyable in Zebra. **Satyadev** and the rest of the cast give strong performances, and the thrilling scenes stand out. However, the screenplay feels less engaging in certain parts, and a few dull scenes in the second half are some of **Zebra's** weaknesses.
