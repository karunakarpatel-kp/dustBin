## Plot Overview:

In 1850, in the village of Veppur, North Arcot, lived **Thangalaan** with his wife, Gengamma, and their children. Thangalaan was respected by the villagers because he was the chief and owned land, unlike most villagers who worked as bonded laborers on the zamindar's land. One night, Thangalaan shared a story with his children about Aarathi, a tribal woman believed to be a protector of the land and skilled in using sorcery to safeguard the gold-rich forests.

The story goes back to Thangalaan's great-grandfather, **Kaadaiyan**, who was skilled in finding gold in the Ponnar river. When a king wanted the gold, Aarathi used her powers to create obstacles, making it difficult for Kaadaiyan to help. The king, believing Aarathi was responsible, beheaded a Buddha statue, which enraged Aarathi. A battle broke out, ending with Kaadaiyan defeating Aarathi. Her blood mixed with the land, turning the sand into gold.

Years later, **Thangalaan's land** is taken by the zamindar after their farm produce is destroyed. Meanwhile, British officer Lord Clement arrives seeking gold, knowing the villagers' expertise. Thangalaan, his son Asokan, and other villagers venture into the forest, despite Aarathi's warnings. Despite various dangers like snakes and lightning, Thangalaan persists. However, when they find gold, Clement steals it, claiming it as British property.

Thangalaan, angered by this, fights to protect his community and their land, finally finding native gold, bringing hope and prosperity to his people.

### Conclusion

In 1850, in the village of **Veppur**, North Arcot, **Thangalaan** fought hard to protect his community and their land from being exploited by outsiders. After losing his land to the zamindar and enduring the hardships of forced labor, Thangalaan's determination never wavered. He continued to dream of his past lives as Arasan "Aaran," the tribal king who once ruled and protected the land alongside Aarathi.

**Thangalaan's journey** was not just about finding gold but about reclaiming the dignity and freedom of his people. Despite many challenges, including betrayal by those he once trusted, and being deceived by British officers like Lord Clement, Thangalaan refused to give up. His perseverance led him to uncover the hidden gold, not for personal wealth, but to uplift his community and give them a sense of pride and self-sufficiency.

The final battle with **Aarathi**, where she revealed his past lives, was a turning point. Thangalaan understood that the true wealth lay not just in the gold but in the unity of his people and their ability to protect their land. With Aarathi's blessing to retrieve the gold only for his community's benefit, Thangalaan continued to work tirelessly. He ultimately discovered abundant native gold, symbolizing hope, resilience, and justice for his people.

**Thangalaan's story** was not just one of gold mining but of cultural preservation, respect for traditions, and standing up against oppression. His legacy lived on as a symbol of strength and the fight for freedom, ensuring that the land remained in the hands of those who cherished it the most.
