## Plot Overview:

The story takes place in 2008. **PMRK Prasad (Shanmukh Jaswanth)** is a college student who has a crush on his classmate Leela (Anagha Ajith) but finds it hard to share his feelings. After graduation, they exchange phone numbers and start chatting,

Encouraged by his friend **Rajesh (Mirchi Saran)**, Prasad gathers the courage to tell or express his love towards her. However, Leela suddenly stops responding to his messages or even calls or whatsapp messages. Feeling confused and worried, Prasad is left wondering and confused what went wrong. Did she not feel the same way as I had did when I told her about my feelings? Or did something happen to her? Determined to get answers, Prasad and his friends set out to uncover the truth, and the movie reveals what really happened.

**Love**, **crush**, or **attraction** - whatever you call it, it always feels special during teenage years. _Leela Vinodham_ tells the sweet story of a boy trying to understand out if the girl who he loves feels the same way.

The story is simple but brings back memories, especially for those who remember when **mobile phones** were new and exciting for students in India.

**Shanmukh** does a good job as a young man overthinking his feelings for someone he cares about. Anagha is delightful, and their chemistry is enjoyable to watch. The real star, though, is Mirchi Saran, who steals the show with his funny moments and a well-crafted role.

The supporting cast, including **Shanmukh's** friends, does a decent job, and Prasad Behara adds a lot of humor in his short but memorable scenes.

### Conclusion

_**Leela Vinodham**_ is really a sweet village love story, but it's not super exciting as it is expected. Shanmukh and Anagha had done their job(acting) well, and Mirchi Saran is funny jokes in middle and makes you laugh. But sometimes, the movie feels a bit slow and doesn't show enough **strong emotions** or **feelings** to make it very special. The story is nice and simple, but it could have been told in a way that makes you feel more for the characters. Some people might like other movies better.
