At the same time, Rangachari, a storyteller, captivates the villagers with performances about Lord Vishnu's avatars through his theater group, **Rangachari Nataka Mandali**.

Things take a dark turn when brutal murders occur in the village, mirroring the **Vishnu avatar Rangachari** performs on that day. The villagers are convinced these killings are divine acts, but police officer Virat has doubts and starts investigating.

### Conclusion

**Harikatha** is a simple and average story about revenge. The idea of God being connected to the murders is intriguing, and it keeps you curious to some extent. However, the revenge plot feels repetitive and doesn't bring much excitement. The suspense adds a little bit of mystery, but it's not enough to make the story stand out. In the end, the series feels underwhelming and doesn't leave a lasting impression. While there are moments that catch your attention, they are few and far between. If you're looking for something thrilling and memorable, Harikatha might not fully satisfy.
