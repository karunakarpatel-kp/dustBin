## Plot Overview:

**Satyabhama (Alia Bhatt)** cares deeply for her younger brother, **Ankur (Vedang Raina)**. When Ankur travels to Malaysia with his cousin for studies, things take a terrible turn. Ankur is unfairly blamed for having illegal drugs, something his cousin was involved in, and ends up in a high-security prison with a death sentence looming over him.

As satyabhama decides to save hi, she travels to Malaysia to bring her brother back to his home. Meanwhile, she had crossed paths with **Bhatia ( Manoj Pahwa)** who is a retired gangstaer where his son was also in prison. With the help of Mutu help of **Muthu (Rahul Ravindran)**, a former cop,they just decided a daring plan to free Ankur. During this time Ankur and his fellow inmates starts plotting their own escape.

The story is about the question,Will **Satyabhama's** plan succeed? Can she bring Ankur back safely? The movie reveals the answers to these gripping questions.

**Alia Bhatt** gives a heartfelt performance as a protective sister, truly standing out in the action-packed moments toward the film's conclusion. Her emotions feel real and impactful, leaving a strong impression.

**Vedang Raina** performs his role adequately, while Manoj Pahwa and Rahul Ravindran provide solid support, adding depth to the story.

However, the movie's storyline is fairly predictable, which makes it less engaging. For viewers who have already seen the trailer, the film doesn't offer many surprises. The pacing is slow at times, and the emotional connection between the brother and sister isn't explored as deeply as it could have been, leaving the audience wanting more.

Moreover, the film lacks standout dialogue and thrilling action sequences, which makes the runtime feel unnecessarily long. Many viewers might find themselves counting down the minutes until it's over.
