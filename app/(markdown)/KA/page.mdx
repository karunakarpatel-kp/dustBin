## Plot Overview:

One night, in a secret place, a man wearing a mask tells his helpers to catch two people named **Abhinaya Vasudev** and **Radha**. After a tough fight, they manage to capture Vasudev and bring him to their boss while he's still sleeping.

When **Vasudev** wakes up, he finds himself in a dark room. There's a strange clock on a table—it looks spooky but also kind of interesting because of the weird shapes on it. Soon, the boss walks in and asks Vasudev about a letter sent to someone named Abead Shaik. **Vasudev** says he doesn't know anything, but the boss tells him the clock is magic and will make him remember everything. The clock starts working, and Vasudev begins to think about his past.

The story goes back to when **Vasudev** was a little boy in an orphanage. He loved reading other people's letters because it helped him understand different kinds of love and relationships. This love for letters made him decide to become a postman in a village called Krishnagiri. This village is special—it's surrounded by mountains, and by 3 PM, shadows cover everything. Vasudev loves living there. He also falls in love with a kind girl named **Satyabhama**, who is his boss's daughter.

But something bad starts happening—girls in the village begin disappearing. At first, **Vasudev** doesn't worry too much, but when someone tries to take Satya, he saves her just in time! He then starts investigating but feels shy about telling the police until he shares his own secrets.

The boss, impressed by **Vasudev's cleverness**, removes his mask. Guess what? The boss looks exactly like Vasudev! On another side of the story, the caretaker of the orphanage adopts a new girl after losing his own daughter. This adopted girl is now having a baby and has returned to her village.

**Vasudev** figures out the truth about the kidnappings. He saves the missing girls but gets hurt badly in the process. Another girl also loses her life during the rescue. But here's the magical part: **Vasudev** and the girl are reborn as siblings to the caretaker's daughter, bringing hope and a fresh start!
