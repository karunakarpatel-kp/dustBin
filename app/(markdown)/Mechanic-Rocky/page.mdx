Rocky pleads with the don for time to arrange ₹40 lakhs to save his driving school. During this time, his father passes away, and Rocky discovers that his father had an insurance policy worth ₹2 crores. Overjoyed, he approaches a bank officer, Maya (Shraddha Srinath), who informs him that the nominee in his father's will is not Rocky but someone else. Who is this new person? Let's find out the real answer to the question what is the **real story** behind the insurance policy in this movie? How does Meenakshi Chaudhary fit into this situation? And did Rocky manage to save his father's beloved school? These form the core of the film.
